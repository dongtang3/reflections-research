The paper "Towards machines that understand people" by Andrew Howes, Jussi P. P. Jokinen, and Antti Oulasvirta presents a novel approach centered on computational rationality for developing cooperative artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can understand and predict human behavior. 

A significant contribution of computational rationality is its ability to answer "what if?" and "why?" questions regarding human behavior. By modeling humans as optimally adapting to their environment and constraints, AI systems can simulate and predict the outcomes of different interventions. This capability is crucial for designing AI that can cooperatively interact with humans, predict the effects of its actions, and understand the causes behind observed behaviors.

The approach acknowledges the complexity of human cognition, including memory, attention, and decision-making processes, as well as the diversity in human behavior and preferences. Computational rationality provides a structured way to explore how behavior adapts to cognitive limits and environmental conditions, offering insights into individual differences and adaptive strategies.
