The study is grounded in an interview study involving 17 participants from various roles within the company, providing insights into the difficulties of training, using, creating dashboards, and transitioning to a digital company. The findings highlight significant socio-technical challenges such as intimidating expertise gaps, extensive self-learning, underappreciated labor, discomfort with interaction, and reliance on static reports despite the introduction of dashboarding tools. Based on these observations, the paper proposes opportunities for both companies and visualization researchers to facilitate these transitions and rethink dashboard system designs to support real-world usage. Key suggestions include developing organization-specific design guidelines, dashboard design process models, narrative dashboards, and tools tailored for collaborative practices. This study adds a new socio-technical perspective to the challenges of adopting visual analytics processes, emphasizing the need for comprehensive training, the complexity of creating effective dashboards, and the importance of collaborative efforts in adopting new data analysis tools
